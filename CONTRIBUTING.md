# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! This project is intentionally small and easy to work on. The guidelines below help keep changes consistent and easy to review.

## Getting started
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes.
3. Ensure the server still starts and the UI behaves as expected.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change.

## Development notes
- The server entrypoint is `src/simpleserver.py`.
- Keep the UI changes minimal and in plain HTML/CSS since the project is dependency-free.
- If you add new behavior, update the README to keep the feature list accurate.

## Commit messages
Use short, descriptive commit messages (e.g., "Add download progress to UI").

## Reporting issues
If you find a bug, please include:
- The command you used to start the server.
- The directory you served.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant logs from the terminal output.
